Hi! I'm Dylan, one of your TAs. I use they/them pronouns. 

### Why I'm TA'ing eTextiles

This class is the _coolest_ way to get non-CS people comfortable with computer science, and I'm super excited to help that happen! I'm a CS major with a decent amount of experience doing various fibercrafts, so this class is a pretty perfect combination of several of my areas of expertise. I'm here as a resource for you all. Please ask me questions!

### As thanks for checking out my website...
here are some pictures of my dog Andie!
