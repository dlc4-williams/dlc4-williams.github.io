Hello world! I’m Dylan Chan, they/them pronouns. I’m a Senior studying Computer Science. 

# Experience

## Programming
I’ve been programming for about 3 years now, and I can write C, Java, Javascript, and a little bit of Python. 

## Sewing
I got good at hand-sewing my sophomore year, when I took a quilting art class here! This is the quilt that came out of that class:



I do some other fiber arts as well:




# What I hope to learning
I don’t know much about circuits, and I’ve never tried to integrate anything electronic into my fiberarts projects, so I’m super excited to learn how to do that!

# Boring fact
The boringest fact I can think of about me is that I eat the same breakfast almost every day: a bowl of oatmeal with a tiny bit of brown sugar.
